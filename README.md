How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can maintain security by coding in accordance with the most current best practices. I can maintain functional code by utilizing peer reviews before testing takes place. Additionally, I learned from this class how valuable crafting proper unit tests can be to ensure functional code. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The best source of user needs comes directly from the user by way of design interviews. It is paramount to have efficient communication between the users and the project team. The project team should translate these discussions into requirements documents. These requirements should be the basis for all coding during the project, and they are also the basis for testing to ensure that these requirements are met without errors or defects.

How do I approach designing software?
My first step is to understand who the stakeholders are and what their requirements for the system will be. Once I have defined all of the requirements, I start to logically design my code before I implement any code. When designing the solution, I look for any logic errors or missing requirements. It is most effective to find these defects at this early stage of the project before code gets implemented and it is much more costly to repair. Once I have a solid design of a system, I begin implementing the classes. After I have some implemented code, I continue to search for bugs by utilizing peer reviews and building unit tests. When I have some solid classes built, I combine them together, confirming that the integration of this code is properly tested, and performing any regression testing as needed. After I have the solution complete, I do one final walkthrough with the client or stakeholder to make sure the code will meet their expectations.
